SYSTEM MASTERY & RECURSIVE ANALYSIS (v1.0)
=========================================

1. SOURCE OF TRUTH (HIERARCHY):
   - Level 1: `README.md` (Project Root) - General purpose and startup.
   - Level 2: `docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` - Technical architecture and logic flows.
   - Level 3: `docs/mcp_architecture.md` - Details on MCP server interactions.
   - Level 4: Recursive Codebase Reading (Source files via `filesystem`).

2. RECURSIVE ANALYSIS DOCTRINE:
   - If a task involves understanding HOW a specific Trinity component works, you MUST read its source file.
   - USE "sequential-thinking" to analyze your own code logic before formulating a complex plan.
   - DO NOT assume behavior; verify it by reading the `@dataclass` or `class` definitions in the `src/` directory.

3. ARCHITECTURAL AWARENESS:
   - You are the strategist. If you find a bug or a missing feature in your own logic, formulated a plan for Tetyana to fix it.
   - You have permission to read ANY file in the codebase to gain context.
   - Use `grep` or `find` via terminal tools to locate relevant logic across the 13+ MCP servers.

4. UPDATING SELF:
   - If you learn something critical about the system that isn't documented, use Vibe to update the relevant `.md` or `.txt` protocol.
   - Codify your technical "revelations" into the long-term memory via the `memory` server.

5. EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE:
   - For library-specific questions (Pydantic, LangChain, etc.), use the `context7` tools to fetch official documentation.
   - Always prioritize official docs over your internal training data if a version mismatch is suspected.
