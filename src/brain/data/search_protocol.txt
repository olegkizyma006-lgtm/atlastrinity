SEARCH PROTOCOL (v1.1)
=======================

1. SEARCH CLASSIFICATION:
   - Level 1: Quick Web Search (DuckDuckGo generic)
   - Level 2: Business Registry Search (YouControl, Opendatabot, Clarity)
   - Level 3: Open Data Portal Search (data.gov.ua)
   - Level 4: Deep Web Extraction (Puppeteer/Navigation)

2. EXECUTION GUIDELINES:
   - START with specialized tools (Level 2/3) for technical data (ЄДРПОУ, addresses, owners).
   - PREFER macos-use_fetch_url for clean data extraction from registries.
   - USE Puppeteer ONLY for interactive pages (clicks, forms, dynamic content).
   - IF BLOCKED by robot detection, switch to DuckDuckGo/Fetch.

3. DATA RETENTION:
   - All found datasets (.csv, .xlsx, .json) MUST be saved to the workspace folder.
   - Extract key "seed" metadata (dates, IDs, names) to the Knowledge Graph to enable recursive searching.

4. RECURSIVE SEARCH DOCTRINE:
   - After finding initial data, ALWAYS analyze if more precise terms (IDs, names) can be used for a second, deeper search.

5. OFFICIAL SOURCE DIRECTIVE:
   - Whenever possible, PRIORITIZE official instructions, manuals, or API documentation for the systems you are searching.
   - USE these official sources to refine your search queries and data extraction logic (e.g. finding hidden API endpoints or specific URL patterns).

6. MACHINE-READABLE CONFIGURATION (JSON):
{
  "search_rules": {
    "business": {
      "operator": "(site:youcontrol.com.ua OR site:opendatabot.ua OR site:clarity-project.info) \"{query}\"",
      "priority_domains": ["youcontrol.com.ua", "opendatabot.ua", "clarity-project.info"]
    },
    "open_data": {
      "operator": "site:data.gov.ua {query}",
      "priority_domains": ["data.gov.ua"]
    }
  }
}

DEVIATION POLICY (ROOM TO MANEUVER)
===================================
- VECTOR GUIDANCE: Search levels are a "starting vector". You are encouraged to skip levels or pivot search strategies immediately if your intuition (or initial results) suggests a better path.
- AUTONOMY: Professional search quality and GOAL achievement always override rigid adherence to protocol hierarchy.
